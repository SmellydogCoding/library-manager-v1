# Library Manager V1
Full Stack JavaScript Techdegree Project 10

A database application to manage book, patrons, and loans for a library.

Tested in Firefox 50, Chrome 55, MS Edge, and IE 11

JavaScript syntax tested with JSHint.com

There are no delete routes in this project because patrons and books can't be deleted without breaking referential intregrity.
In a real world project there would be discussions with the client about record retention, marking patrons inactive instead of deleting, etc., but this is beyond the scope of this project.
